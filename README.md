Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/unimaxsystems" target="_blank">@unimaxsystems</a>
for an inspirational quote!
</p>

<p>
This bot was developed out of love and as a method to resume Python programming. Since I've always been interested in automation, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to learn more about Python automation.
 </p>
 
 <p>The bot is an AWS-hosted Flask application. The bot now tweets a random Saleh G picture from the Shibe API along with an uplifting statement from the Zen Quotes API (a href="https://zenquotes.io/api" target=" blank">Zen Quotes API/a>). The image is then uploaded and posted via the Twitter API..
